                    <p>In a novel that fuses the riveting action of The Boys in the Boat with the emotional heft of The Fault in Our Stars, 
                        twenty men and women with cancer-ridden bodies compete in a grueling race only to discover that real victory is achieved within.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After he is diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer, Tripp Avery feels like all is lost. 
                        He finds himself coaching a team of twelve men and eight women with cancer diagnoses of their own,
                        hoping to qualify for the Mixed Masters Dragon Boat national championship and defy their prognoses. 
                        If they win, they will represent the United States at the International Dragon Boat races in Hong Kong.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But things soon get complicated, as four of his teammates struggle against their physical limitations and the psychological weight of their conditions. 
                        In the summer heat of Chattanooga, their resolve grows thinâ€”along with Tripp's patience. After a devastating loss to the defending national champions, 
                        Tripp can only see the finish line, and he pushes the team even harder. Soon, the team starts to fall apart.</p>
